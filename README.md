# New Paltz #1 course
## webdevcw
I’m a Computer Science major. I transferred to SUNY New Paltz after completing an Associate’s Degree in Computer Science at SUNY Westchester CC. I also completed an Associate’s Degree in Cybersecurity. I've taken Computer Science 1,2,3, Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. The remaining programming classes I have left to take at New Paltz are the Compiler class, Projects, and Object Oriented Programming. I completed a project using an Apache Tomcat webserver to let users select a soccer team from a menu and receive the roster. The roster would be copied from a table in the HTML content on the soccer team’s Wikipedia page.
I hope to use the knowledge gained in this course to improve my ability to create my own web-based projects for my resume and also for the Projects class next semester. Specifically, I am looking forward to learning more about cloud computing and integrating other technologies into my websites, rather than mainly only static content. Additionally, I am also looking forward to learn how to properly secure a public facing web server. My goal is to create an image host and storage server.
